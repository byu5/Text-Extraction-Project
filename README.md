# Text-Extraction-Project


The goal of this project is to collect the text (storyline) from multiple word docs and aggregate into one single word document (output.docx). 

The excel spreadsheet that contains the author name, email address, file name, and their workplace that we need in the final work output.

In the Excel file, there is a column called "Flie name." Thus, if you want to extract the storyline from certain word document. You have to input the word document's name into the File name column for each indicator. Besides, the word document has to follow the standard format in order to extrat information from it. If the file is not in the standard format, the code will output the its file name. What's more, in order for the code to work, the word documents, excel spreadsheet and the code file have to be in the same directory.
